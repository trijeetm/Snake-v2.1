Snake-v2.0
==========

A redesign of the classic game Snake in a C++ environment. Implemented on a console interface, with ASCII graphics. Improvements inlcude a multiplayer mode, and dynamic levels.

This was a project for my high school CS class, and has been compiled using the Borland Turbo C++ compiler (archaic, yes - but it was a requirement for the project).
The .exe build is is available to use, or one can compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
